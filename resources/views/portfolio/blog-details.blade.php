                    <h4>which is better for cross-platform application development?</h4>
                    <p>With the rising popularity of mobile platforms, a lot of technologies and frameworks are
                        running between the race to make
                        things simpler and smoother for customers. However, choosing the right technology to meet
                        your objectives is essential for
                        long-term success and provide a better user experience.</p>
                    <h4>In this article, we will discuss two of the most famous frameworks – Ionic and React Native
                    </h4>
                    <p>Ionic is a hybrid mobile app development framework while React Native is a cross-platform
                        native app development framework. Let me
                        explain in much more detail about hybrid and native app frameworks to have a better
                        understanding.</p>
                    <h4>Hybrid Mobile App Framework v/s Native App Framework</h4>
                    <p>A hybrid mobile app framework is used for building web applications that build with web
                        technologies such as HTML, CSS,
                        and JavaScript. These Web applications can run on multiple browsers such as Chrome, Safari
                        and other web browser.
                        The important advantage of using a hybrid mobile app framework is that they are
                        budget-friendly. Some examples of hybrid
                        mobile apps are Evernote, Baskin Robbins, Uber, etc.
                        On the other hand, a native app framework is one that is used for building native apps in a
                        specific language for a specific
                        platform. For example, a React Native iOS app will be written in Objective C or a React
                        Native Android app will be written in
                        Java. The prime advantage of using a native app framework is a fast and reliable
                        performance. Some React Native app examples
                        are Facebook, Skype, Instagram, Walmart etc.
                        Now let us take a look at the popular frameworks in detail.</p>
                    <h4>React Native – Cross-platform Native App Framework</h4>
                    <a>https://facebook.github.io/react-native</a>
                    <p>Features of the React Native framework:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reusable components on both iOS and Android.</li>
                        <li>Code can be easily understood and modified by the developers hence it takes less time to
                            develop app.</li>
                        <li>It has a wide community of developers.</li>
                        <li> With the help of virtual-DOM support, changes can be seen in real-time.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>Write developer experience in few words:</h4>
                    <p>Working for a<a> software development company</a>, we asked certain questions to our
                        developers who have worked on Ionic
                        and React native app programming and building app cycle. Based on their experience we can
                        suggest that when your app
                        highly depends on the ready code and if the goal is to develop and deploy an app in a short
                        time, then Ionic would be the
                        best choice. And if there is a requirement of an app with high performance with a unique
                        end-user interface, responsive UI,
                        and amazing user experience, then React Native would be the best choice.</p>
